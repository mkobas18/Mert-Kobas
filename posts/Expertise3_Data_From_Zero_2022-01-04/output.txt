Human languages are structured to best convey our
thoughts and feelings. Words and their meanings likely form ideal matches.
There are absolutely no good reasons why
we use specific words to represent our thoughts. Any combination of sounds
could in principle refer to any idea.
The fact that elementary school stops at 5th grade is probably ideal for children's learning. This is likely the best way to organize K-12 schooling.
Middle school (grades 6-8) is separate from elementary school (grades K-5) largely because of decisions made by educators a long time ago. This may not be the most optimal way of organizing early education.
It’s not a coincidence that
we send people cards on holidays. This tradition seems
particularly fitting.
The fact that we send people cards on holidays is only a convention. A different way of sending warm wishes could've been implemented just as easily.
There are good reasons why orange juice
is typically consumed for breakfast. There are features about it that make it
particularly suited for this meal (for example, its refreshing taste).
The current popularity of orange juice for breakfast reflects
in part  marketing campaigns that promoted
drinking orange juice in the morning. However, had history taken a different
turn, orange juice could just as easily have been more popular for lunch or
dinner.
It seems right to use white for wedding dresses. Other
colors, such as red and blue, have features that make them less suited for
wedding dresses.
Even though white is the
traditional color for wedding dresses, this could have easily been different.
When you really think about it, there is no reason why other, brighter, colors couldn’t
be used for wedding dresses.
It seems ideal that toothpaste is
typically flavored with mint. Mint is inherently more refreshing than any other
flavor that currently exists.
When you think about it, toothpaste could have easily been
flavored with something other than mint, such as cinnamon. Many pleasing flavors would work just as
well.
Traffic lights, with three
different colored lights signaling three speeds, seem like the most efficient
and effective way to direct traffic. Another process likely would not work as
well.
The current design of traffic lights,
with three different colors reflecting three different speeds, is entirely due
to historical factors. This is probably not the most efficient or effective way
to manage traffic.
Black seems like a good choice for the color of televisions. Other colors just would not work as well.
The
only reason why most TVs are black is
historical happenstance. TVs could practically be a
variety of colors.

I would prefer complex to simple problems.
I like to have the responsibility of handling a situation that requires a lot of thinking.
Thinking is not my idea of fun.
I would rather do something that requires little thought than something that is sure to challenge my thinking abilities.
I try to anticipate and avoid situations where there is a likely chance I will have to think in depth about something.
I find satisfaction in deliberating hard and long for hours.
I only think as hard as I have to.
I prefer to think about small, daily projects rather than long-term ones.
I like tasks that require little thought once I’ve learned them.
The idea of relying on thought to make my way to the top appeals to me.
I really enjoy a task that involves coming up with new solutions to problems.
Learning new ways to think doesn’t excite me very much.
I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve.
The notion of thinking abstractly appeals to me.
I would prefer a task that is intellectual, difficult, and important to one that is somewhat important but does not require much thought.
I feel relief rather than satisfaction after completing a task that required a lot of mental effort.
It’s enough for me that something gets the job done; I don’t care about why or how it works.
I usually end up deliberating about issues even when they do not affect me personally.
