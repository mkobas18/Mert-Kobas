## **Diagnostic Hypothesis Generation and Human Judgment**

The focus of this article is providing a model of human judgment (Hygene) that describes

-   How hypotheses are generated on the basis of data extracted from the environment

-   How the hypotheses generated from memory are used to make probability judgments

-   How the generated hypotheses frame subsequent information search in hypothesis-testing situations
