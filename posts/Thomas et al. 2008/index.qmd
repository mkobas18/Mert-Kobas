## **Diagnostic Hypothesis Generation and Human Judgment**

The focus of this article is providing a model of human judgment/reasoning (Hygene).

*The universe of* *possible states* means external events related to data that provides a basis to generate hypothesis.

*Hypothesis* means mental representation of an external event, so decision making process requires learning some subset of the external events. Which subset is an important question here with how this learning happens (e.g., self-explanation, associations or relational understanding?).

### Hygene

Three principles

-   "Data extracted from the environment serve as memory retrieval cues that prompt the retrieval of diagnostic hypotheses from long-term memory."

    [Comment1a:]{.underline} Data works as the probing items to retrieve hypothesis from ltm, so it's maybe like when I saw a shark tail in the ocean, I can retrieve that there may be a shark in the ocean because that shape of tails is specific to sharks.

-   "The number of diagnostic hypotheses that one can actively entertain at any point in time is constrained by both cognitive limitations and task characteristics."

    [Comment1b:]{.underline}So heuristics and biases play a role to limit the number of diagnostic hypotheses. For the previous example, I may not think that the tail is a joke and a person is using to scare people (an extrinsic reason).

-   "Hypotheses maintained in the focus of attention (i.e., WM) serve as input into a comparison process to derive probability judgments and frame information search."

    [Comment1c:]{.underline}Hypotheses in WM initate the probability judgement and h-testing.

Hygene consists of three parts:

-   H Generation: How hypotheses are generated on the basis of data extracted from the environment

    -People generate few H's without any limitation, fewer H's under time pressure.

    Q1: We are here again, what is the mechanism behind time pressure? Would it be same thing if we also limit the data usage(watching video only 1 time vs. several times example)?

    -People generate H's highest in a priori probability. (Like in the shark example, few h's but those have highest probability (effort for effective usage of cognitive resources?))

    -Number of H's is constrained by WM limitations.

-   H Evaluation: How the hypotheses generated from memory are used to make probability judgments

-   H Testing: How the generated hypotheses frame subsequent information search in hypothesis-testing situations

They had different simulations to test their models. In the simulation 1, they tested their 1st principle, which is H generation.

How they modeled *the amount of experience* seems important here. They defined this as the number of traces stored in the model's episodic memory. So, it probably means that experience provides more alternative and plausible hypotheses, which explains their results also (Figure 4, p.165). They found that the traces of real event are more distorted, experience becomes effective. Experience provides true interpretation of distorted data/observations. It makes sense I guess, but only if the task/observation is a thing that can be grasped easily.
