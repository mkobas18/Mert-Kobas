This post includes an example for R codes or to test how R deal with different calculations.

### Import made-up data

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Import library ----
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(jmv)


#Read the csv file ----
ice<-read_csv("~/Desktop/ice cream data.csv")

head(ice)

```

## Operations with missing values

Participant 2, 4 and 5 have missing values, let's calculate Bmi and a summing operation with mutate function:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Transform height to meter
ice<-ice%>%
  mutate(Height1=Height/100)

ice<-ice%>%
  mutate(bmi=Weight/(Height1*Height1),
         sum=Weight+(10-Height1))

head(ice)
```

R handled missing values in arithmetic operations, it didn't omit them or replaced them with 0, that's great news!
